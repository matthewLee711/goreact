React:
JS View Library 
Babel - translate es2015/2016 syntax in old school es5

//Channel should have components of react
class Channel extends React.Component

//render
converts html into jsx or java script code

//Type serve to load up page

Properties: pass information to components (bidirectional)
<Channel name='Hardware'/>
Channel will recieve something called name which will adpot it
//This line below accepts the name set
{this.props.name}
//you can use injection for everything. not jjust string

For event handlers:
Originally you had to bind functions to use them within a component
////this.onClick.bind(this) <oldschool method for calling functions

Composition: parent React Component
Pass the Channel Array as a property to the ChannelList(use controller view later)
Create property for channellist with takes in channel arr.

ARRAY:
keys keep track of of renders
Need to re-render array when adding stuff to it
USE a common parent for components that need access

Dynamically adding channels:

You can only pass a single react 'Parent component' to be rendered
Each JSX is is converted to a function call, so passing two function calls 
doesnt make sense
EX.
<somecomponent />
Reac.createElement(SomeComponent, null) <two of these will be passed to
the document.getelementbyid

SO create a parent component that will pass parent and child components
var ChannelSection = React.createClass({
	render : function() { //create property as channel list
		return (
			<div>
				<ChannelList channels={channels}/>
				<ChannelForm />
			</div>
		)
	}
});
